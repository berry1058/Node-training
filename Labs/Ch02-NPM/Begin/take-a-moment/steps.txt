Letâ€™s get a package called Moment

npm install moment

notice that node_modules directory is created

then create in same directory timeExample.js with this code:
var moment = require('moment');
console.log(moment().format('MM-DD-YYYY'));

execute using node timeExample.js or leave off the .js extension

this is close to the demo
what are some other common packages they can work with
for some JS coding usage?
